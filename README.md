# Description:

The Tic Tac Toe GUI game is a graphical user interface (GUI) version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. It provides a visually appealing and interactive way for users to play the game on their computer screens.

# Key Features:

1.User-Friendly Interface: The game features a clean and intuitive interface designed using Tkinter, a standard GUI toolkit for Python. Players can easily navigate through the game controls and interact with the game board.

2.Interactive Game Board: The game board is displayed graphically, featuring a grid layout representing the Tic Tac Toe grid. Each cell of the grid acts as a clickable button, allowing players to make their moves by clicking on the desired cell.

3.Player vs. Player Mode: The game supports a two-player mode, where two human players can take turns making their moves on the game board. The interface indicates which player's turn it is, ensuring smooth gameplay flow.

4.Visual Feedback: The game provides visual feedback to players, such as highlighting the selected cell and displaying X or O marks on the corresponding grid cell.

5.Win Detection: The game automatically detects winning conditions, such as when a player achieves three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) and declares the winner. Additionally, it detects a draw condition when all cells on the board are filled without a winner.

6.Reset and Replay: Players have the option to reset the game board and start a new game at any time.
